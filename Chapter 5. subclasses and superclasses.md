# Chapter 5. subclasses and superclasses: Using Your Inheritance

## Inheritance helps you avoid duplicate code

The class that contains the common code is called the superclass, and the classes that inherit from it are called subclasses.<br>
A superclass is sometimes called a base class, and a subclass is sometimes called a derived class. In this book, weâ€™re sticking with superclass and subclass.

A superclass contains common properties and functions that are inherited by one or more subclasses.<br>
A subclass can include extra properties and functions, and can override the things that it inherits.
