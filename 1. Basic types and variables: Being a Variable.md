## Floating points
There are two basic floating-point types: Float and Double. Floats can hold 32 bits, whereas Doubles can hold 64 bits.<br>
By default, if you declare a variable by assigning a floating-point number to it using code like:<br>
var x = 123.5
<br>
you will create an object and variable of type Double. If you add an “F” or “f” to the end of the number, a Float will get created instead:<br>
var x = 123.5F<br>

**An object has state and behavior**
Being an object means that it has two things: state and behavior.<br>
An object’s state refers to the data that’s associated with the object: its properties and values. A numeric object, for example, has a numeric value, such as 5, 42 or 3.12 (depending on the object’s
type). A Char object has a value that’s a single character. A Boolean is either true or false.
An object’s behavior describes the things the object can do, or that can be done to it. A String can be capitalized, for example. Numeric objects know how to perform basic math, and convert their value into an object of a different numeric type. The object’s behavior is exposed through its functions.

## How to convert a numeric value to another type

Every numeric type has the following conversion functions: toByte(), toShort(), toInt(), toLong(), toFloat() and toDouble().
```kotlin
var x = 5
var z: Long = x.toLong()
var x = 42L
var y: Int = x.toInt() //Value is 42
```

**How to explicitly define the array’s type**

```kotlin
var myArray: Array<Byte> = arrayOf(1, 2, 3)
 ```
 
# Chapter 3. functions: Getting Out of Main  

```kotlin
fun getGameChoice(optionsParam: Array<String>) = optionsParam[(Math.random() * optionsParam.size).toInt()]
```

## Looping through a range of numbers
```kotlin
for (x in 1..10) {
  //Your code goes here
}
```
Note that the .. operator includes the end number in its range. If you wanted to exclude it, you would
replace the .. operator with until. As an example, the following code prints the numbers from 1 to 99, and excludes 100:

```kotlin
for (x in 1 until 100) println(x)
```

Use downTo to reverse the range<br>
If you want to loop through a range of numbers in reverse order, you use downTo instead of .. or until  

```kotlin
for(x in downTo 1) println(x)
```

**Use step to skip numbers in the range**
for (x in 1..100 step 2) println(x)

**Looping through the items in an array**
```kotlin
for (item in optionsParam) {
  println("$item is an item in the array")
}
```

```kotlin
for ((index,item) in optionsParam) {
  println("$item is an item in the array")
}
```

**Use the readLine function to read the user’s input**

val userInput = readLine()
