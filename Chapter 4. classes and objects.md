# Chapter 4. classes and objects: A Bit of Class

## Object types are defined using classes

## How to design your own classes

When you want to define your own class, you need to think about the objects that will be created from that class. You need to consider:
- The things each object knows about itself. 
- The things each object can do.

The things an object knows about itself are its properties. They represent an object’s state (the data), and each object of that type can have unique values. A Dog class, for example, might have name, weight and breed properties. A Song class might have title and artist properties.

The things an object can do are its functions. They determine an object’s behavior, and may use the object’s properties. <br>

<i>A function that’s defined inside a class is called a member function. It’s sometimes called a method.</i>
